# Introduction

Welcome all to my fullstack webb project called whisper app. This is a website to create posts which I have called whispers. It is a site where users can create/read/update/delete whispers.

## Tools

To create this project I've used NextJs 13 to create both the front- and backend, used Prisma with mongodb adapter, Nextauth to handle my authorization/authentication with the google and credential providers and I have also used React Query to handle my data fetching.

## How to get started

To get started you need first to clone this repository with the comand  
`git clone git@github.com:Albatraoz12/whisper.git`

After you have clone this repository you need to create a .env file in the root of the project and fill in the values for the variables:
